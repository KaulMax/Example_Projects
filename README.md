Code snippets for the UE 5.1, C++ based implementation of Behaviour Tree Tasks and Unreal Engine Smart Objects. Class descriptions are in the .cpp's.
With a little work, the classes can be imported into a project and should work fine, but I built the systems based on a game jam project I was involved in, so the original project had a hell of a lot of overhang.
