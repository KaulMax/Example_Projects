Smart Object and Behaviour Tree Learning Project;
Code snippets for the UE 5.1, C++ based implementation of Behaviour Tree Tasks and Unreal Engine Smart Objects. Class descriptions are in the .cpp's.
With a little work, the classes can be imported into a project and should work fine, but I built the systems based on a game jam project I was involved in, so the original project had a hell of a lot of overhang.
Please note that this is a learning project, so some functionalities may not be implemented correctly. Thank you for your understanding!

Source Code for the Game "SpaceMine";
Also included is the source code for the game SpaceMine. For more information, please visit my website: maxkaul.com.
The game was created in Unreal Engine 4 and includes some third-party dependencies, so I do not recommend attempting to build it.
The code itself was entirely written by me and remains in the state it was in when the project was completed. I have not done any cleanup or added explanatory comments. This is because the game was developed under a very tight one-semester schedule and was also my first Unreal Engine project. I believe it serves as a great example—both to showcase and for myself—as part of my journey.
